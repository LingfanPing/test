# Medical AI Generated Content Detection Dataset

## Dataset Description

The Medical AI Generated Content Detection Dataset is a dataset for detecting AI-generated text in the field of medical question answering. It was generated using various models and prompting methods and consists of 11 categories of AI-generated data and human responses. The data was generated by combining four categories of models and three prompting methods. Cross-validation was performed across different types of generated texts from various methods to facilitate tasks such as large model generation detection and model classification. The dataset aims to provide a benchmark for detecting AI-generated text in the medical domain and studying the generalizability of supervised detection methods.

## Dataset Source

The Medical AI Generated Content Detection Dataset is derived from the [HealthCareMagic-100k](https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor/tree/main) dataset described in the paper "ChatDoctor: A Medical Chat Model Fine-Tuned on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA) Using Medical Domain Knowledge." It consists of single-round doctor-patient question and answer data collected from real online websites, with over 100,000 question-answer pairs.
